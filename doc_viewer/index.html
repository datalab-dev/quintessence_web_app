          Hydrological conditions Mangrove Rehabilitation Salinity Typha
          domingensis Over a period of years, we observed the vegetation changes
          in the western part of the lagoon system of the Cienaga Grande de Santa
          Marta, which is situated on the
          <mark class="word-tag entity loc">Caribbean</mark>
          coast of
          <mark class="word-tag entity gpe">Colombia</mark>
          and is separated from the sea by a sandy barrier. Since the construction
          of the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road between and , the lagoon system has
          been exposed to different interventions in its hydrological make-up, as
          well as changes to the vegetation. During the time of our
          investigations, four periods with different plant cover were
          distinguished. In , the road was bordered by dense mangrove forests. The
          low surface water salinity and the presence of freshwater plants
          indicated the influence of
          <mark class="word-tag entity loc">the Magdalena River</mark>
          . At
          <mark class="word-tag entity date">the beginning of the seventies</mark>
          , the second period was marked by a decrease in the freshwater in-flow
          from the river, which led to an increase in salinity and a gradual decay
          of vegetation. In , the areas formerly covered by mangroves had
          converted into salt flats. The third period began with the
          reconstruction of several channels (-) which renewed the freshwater
          in-flow from the river to the lagoons. The subsequent vegetation
          development was characterized by the establishment of Typha domingensis
          Pers. In ,
          <mark class="word-tag entity date">a year</mark>
          with an unusually high amount of rainfall, this species covered most of
          the former mangrove area in the western part of the lagoon system. The
          very low surface water salinity favored its spread. The last period
          began in /, when growth conditions for T. domingensis became unfavorable
          due to an increase in salinity. Instead, conditions for mangrove
          regeneration improved. This process was slower than expected and is
          still ongoing. The striking vegetation changes indicate the sensitivity
          of the coastal lagoon system to hydrological variability. © Elsevier

          subjected to destructive human activities all over the world. This is
          also true for mangrove forests (Farnsworth and Ellison, ). With the
          increased destruction of these forests, interest has grown in finding
          ways of restoring them, at least in part, to a condition closely
          resembling the original. Generally, the rehabilitation of tropical
          forests is considered to be difficult (Brown and Lugo, ). According to
          Lugo (), mangrove forests are an exception, because the unfavorable *

          http://dx.doi.org/./j.aquabot... growing conditions in the mangrove
          habitat itself act as a barrier against the invasion of non-mangrove
          species. In fact, a natural regeneration toward a vegetation similar to
          the original one has been observed in many sites where mangroves had
          been destroyed for various reasons. Some examples are the recovery of
          the vegetation after its destruction by hurricanes (for additional
          publications see
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">Piou et al.</mark>
          , ), the re-colonization of mangrove areas after an oil spill (Lewis, ;
          Martin et al., ) and the regeneration of mangroves following the
          restoration of suitable hydrological conditions (Perdomo et al., ).
          However, natural regeneration has not always occurred. This has been
          attributed to the rapid spread of Acrostichum aureum L. (Chapman, ), to
          the establishment of halophytic herbs in former mangrove areas (
          <mark class="word-tag entity norp">Costa</mark>
          and Davy, ) and to the absence of propagules (Lewis, ; Ellison, ; Imbert
          et al., ). We present another recovery scenario observed after the
          destruction of mangrove forests in the lagoon system of the Cie-naga
          Grande de Santa Marta (

          (Fig. A), caused the death of . of originally . km of mangrove forests
          in this area, due to an increase in salinity up to
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">PSU</mark>
          in channels and lagoons (Giraldo et al., ; Sanchez-Paez et al., ). At
          the beginning of the s, plans were elaborated for the restoration of
          historical hydrological conditions. At the same time, a series of
          investigations started to document the effects of the hydraulic works on
          flora and fauna. Of general interest was the reduction of the very high
          salinity (Perdomo et al., ;
          <mark class="word-tag entity gpe">Blanco et al.</mark>
          , ; Rivera-Monroy et al., , ). Concerning botanical aspects, particular
          attention was paid to mangrove regeneration at different sites (Perdomo
          et al., ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Studies were conducted on propagule
          production and spread (Ensminger, ;
          <mark class="word-tag entity gpe">Schubert</mark>
          , ) as well as seedling establishment and growth (Elster et al., ;
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">Perdomo</mark>
          and Schnetter, ). Remote sensing data were used to assess the expansion
          of mangroves (Sanchez-Paez et al., ; Ibarra et al., ) and to produce a
          canopy height map (Simard et al., ). Models were elaborated to predict
          the future development of the mangrove forests (
          <mark class="word-tag entity gpe">Twilley et al.</mark>
          , ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Soon after the beginning of the restoration
          measures in , it became clear that regeneration in the eastern, more
          saline part of the lagoon system and the western part differed. While
          mangroves recovered step by step to the original species composition and
          zonation in the eastern part, establishment of new mangroves was slow in
          the western part. Instead, a rapid spread of herbaceous freshwater
          plants was observed (Perdomo et al., ; Alvarez-Leon et al., ;
          Sanchez-Paez et al., ). Among the most frequent species was Typha
          domingensis Pers. (cattail), a native of the freshwater wetlands near
          <mark class="word-tag entity loc">the Magdalena River</mark>
          (Romero-Castaneda, ). Within
          <mark class="word-tag entity date">three years</mark>
          Typha beds occupied large parts of former mangrove areas. But it was not
          clear how this species had been able to establish itself in still very
          saline sediments (Alvarez-Leon et al., ). An establishment of T.
          domingensis after the death of mangrove vegetation was already reported
          by Rubin et al. (). But in this case it was restricted to sites with low
          salinity (- PSU). Therefore the successful expansion on saline sediments
          raised our curiosity, and we wondered whether persistent
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">Typha</mark>
          beds would prevent mangrove recolonization.Our hypothesis was that
          mangrove regeneration would be delayed as long as cattail occupied the
          former mangrove areas. To answer this question we started a series of
          studies in aimed at determining the prevailing factors that enabled T.
          domin-gensis to become established in these areas. We hypothesized that
          the low surface water salinity together with the presence of large bare
          areas allowed the establishment of T. domingensis and that variations in
          salinity of surface water influenced its growth. The influence of the
          cattail on the growth of mangrove trees was tested with Rhizophora
          mangle L. seedlings planted in
          <mark class="word-tag entity date">the year</mark>
          at km south of the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road (Fig. B) (Sanchez-Paez et
          al., ). Our hypothesis was that low light intensity inside the
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">Typha</mark>
          beds would influence the growth of the seedlings. These studies were
          completed by data of surface water salinity and vegetation composition
          recorded in irregular intervals at three sites south of the
          Barranquilla-Cienaga Road (Fig. B) from to . The comparison of plant
          lists made it possible to demonstrate similarities and differences
          between the original vegetation and that which became established after
          the restoration of suitable hydrological conditions. Moreover, the data
          enabled us to look for correlations between the different plant cover
          and the respective hydrological conditions. We hypothesized that
          variations of surface water salinity were particularly important for
          vegetation changes. Therefore we tested the influence of different
          environmental factors together with time on state and extent of the
          three vegetation types: mangroves, T. domingensis and freshwater herbs
          without T. domingensis (w.T.d.). These analyses should help us to answer
          our hypothesis about the possible delay of mangrove regeneration by the
          presence of T. domingensis. . Materials and methods .. Study area and

          the north, the lagoon system is separated from the sea by a sandy
          barrier,
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">the Isla de Salamanca</mark>
          . Sea water can enter the lagoon system through
          <mark class="word-tag entity fac">the Boca de la Barra</mark>
          located on the eastern end of the barrier island (Fig. A). Several
          rivers originating in the
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">Sierra Nevada</mark>
          provide a continuous supply of freshwater (about m s-) to the Cienaga
          <mark class="word-tag entity gpe">Grande</mark>
          lagoon (Mann et al., ). Connections with
          <mark class="word-tag entity loc">the Magdalena River</mark>
          allowed the in-flow of additional freshwater (up to m s-) to the western
          part of the lagoon system until and after the termination of the
          restoration measures (Cotes, ). The climate of the region is hot and
          dry. With a mean annual temperature of °C and a mean
          <mark class="word-tag entity date">annual</mark>
          rainfall of mm in the eastern part of the region and around mm in the
          western part, evaporation generally exceeds precipitation. Rainfalls
          occur during two wet seasons of differing intensities (Fig. ). While the
          duration and distribution of dry and wet seasons is very stable, the
          total annual rainfall can vary considerably over
          <mark class="word-tag entity date">the years</mark>
          (Fig. ). These differences are related to
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">El Nino-Southern Oscillation</mark>
          (ENSO) events (
          <mark class="word-tag entity gpe">Blanco et al.</mark>
          , ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Due to the seasonal distribution of
          rainfall and the simultaneous variation of river discharge, the lagoons
          and channels show seasonal changes of water level. Fluctuations in water
          level due to tides are noticeable only near
          <mark class="word-tag entity fac">the Boca de la Barra</mark>
          (Wiedemann, ). Because of the proximity of the sea and the connection
          between the Fig. .

          saline almost everywhere, although to a varying extent. According to our
          observations, salt concentration is significantly influenced by the
          distance from a fresh water source, the duration and level of flooding,
          and the amount of water exchange among neighboring water bodies. Human
          interventions began with the construction of
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road</mark>
          between and (Fig. A). This road interrupted water exchange between the
          northern and southern part of
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">the Isla de Salamanca</mark>
          (Fig. A). In the s, freshwater flow from
          <mark class="word-tag entity loc">the Magdalena River</mark>
          to the lagoon system declined greatly, due to silting of channels
          connecting
          <mark class="word-tag entity loc">the Magdalena River</mark>
          to the lagoon system and the construction of a road which bordered
          <mark class="word-tag entity loc">the Magdalena River</mark>
          at its eastern side (Fig. A). At
          <mark class="word-tag entity date">the end of the th century</mark>
          , efforts were made toward a restoration of the original hydrological
          conditions of the lagoon system. The most important measures were the
          re-opening of the silted channels Cano Clann, Cano Aguas Negras and Cano
          Renegado-Condazo (Fig. A) between and . The objectives of these works
          were the renovation of the fresh water supply and the reduction of the
          elevated salinity (Perdomo et al., ;

          from the river to
          <mark class="word-tag entity fac">the Boca de la Barra</mark>
          and the sea. Intense rainfall in , , and (Fig. ) assisted in the
          reduction of salt concentrations of water and soils (Blanco et al., ;
          Rivera-Monroy et al., , ). In the years -, salinity increase due to less
          rainfall (Fig. ) again changed the growth conditions of the vegetation
          (Blanco et al., ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Variable environmental
          conditions of the lagoon system permit the presence of different plant
          communities. The spectrum ranges from tropical thorn bush and wetland
          forests growing near the rivers in soils which are flooded periodically,
          to communities of wetland and halophytic herbs and mangroves.
          Depressions without drainage lack vegetation because of high salt
          concentrations. Among the plant communities, mangroves are most
          important (Alvarez-Leon et al., ; Sanchez-Paez et al., ). Because of the
          richness of its plant and animal life, the lagoon system comprises two
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">National Parks</mark>
          and has been declared as a
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">Ramsar</mark>
          site and
          <mark class="word-tag entity org">Biosphere Reserve</mark>
          . All studies reported here took place in a part of the lagoon system
          located west of the Cienaga Grande lagoon (Fig. A and B). Beginning in ,
          research about surface water salinity and composition of the vegetation
          has been carried out at km , km and km south of
