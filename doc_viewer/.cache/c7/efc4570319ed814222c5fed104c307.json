Since the construction\n        of the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road between and , the lagoon system has\n        been exposed to different interventions in its hydrological make-up, as\n        well as changes to the vegetation. During the time of our\n        investigations, four periods with different plant cover were\n        distinguished. In , the road was bordered by dense mangrove forests. The\n        low surface water salinity and the presence of freshwater plants\n        indicated the influence of\n        <mark class=\"entity loc\">the Magdalena River</mark>\n        . At\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">the beginning of the seventies</mark>\n        , the second period was marked by a decrease in the freshwater in-flow\n        from the river, which led to an increase in salinity and a gradual decay\n        of vegetation. In , the areas formerly covered by mangroves had\n        converted into salt flats. The third period began with the\n        reconstruction of several channels (-) which renewed the freshwater\n        in-flow from the river to the lagoons. The subsequent vegetation\n        development was characterized by the establishment of Typha domingensis\n        Pers. In ,\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">a year</mark>\n        with an unusually high amount of rainfall, this species covered most of\n        the former mangrove area in the western part of the lagoon system. The\n        very low surface water salinity favored its spread. The last period\n        began in /, when growth conditions for T. domingensis became unfavorable\n        due to an increase in salinity. Instead, conditions for mangrove\n        regeneration improved. This process was slower than expected and is\n        still ongoing. The striking vegetation changes indicate the sensitivity\n        of the coastal lagoon system to hydrological variability. © Elsevier\n        B.V. All rights reserved. . Introduction Tropical forests have been\n        subjected to destructive human activities all over the world. This is\n        also true for mangrove forests (Farnsworth and Ellison, ). With the\n        increased destruction of these forests, interest has grown in finding\n        ways of restoring them, at least in part, to a condition closely\n        resembling the original. Generally, the rehabilitation of tropical\n        forests is considered to be difficult (Brown and Lugo, ). According to\n        Lugo (), mangrove forests are an exception, because the unfavorable *\n        Corresponding author. Tel.: + ; fax: + . E-mail addresses:\n        Marina.Roederstein@gmx.de (M.

In fact, a natural regeneration toward a vegetation similar to\n        the original one has been observed in many sites where mangroves had\n        been destroyed for various reasons. Some examples are the recovery of\n        the vegetation after its destruction by hurricanes (for additional\n        publications see\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Piou et al.</mark>\n        , ), the re-colonization of mangrove areas after an oil spill (Lewis, ;\n        Martin et al., ) and the regeneration of mangroves following the\n        restoration of suitable hydrological conditions (Perdomo et al., ).\n        However, natural regeneration has not always occurred. This has been\n        attributed to the rapid spread of Acrostichum aureum L. (Chapman, ), to\n        the establishment of halophytic herbs in former mangrove areas (\n        <mark class=\"entity norp\">Costa</mark>\n        and Davy, ) and to the absence of propagules (Lewis, ; Ellison, ; Imbert\n        et al., ). We present another recovery scenario observed after the\n        destruction of mangrove forests in the lagoon system of the Cie-naga\n        Grande de Santa Marta (\n        <mark class=\"entity gpe\">Colombia</mark>\n        ) (Fig. ). Between M. Roderstein etal. / Aquatic Botany () - Fig. . (A)\n        Map of the lagoon system of the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta. The study\n        area is marked by a rectangle. (B) Map of the study area and location of\n        the study sites. and , the reduction of freshwater in-flow from\n        <mark class=\"entity loc\">the Magdalena River</mark>\n        (Fig. A), caused the death of . of originally . km of mangrove forests\n        in this area, due to an increase in salinity up to\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">PSU</mark>\n        in channels and lagoons (Giraldo et al., ; Sanchez-Paez et al., ). At\n        the beginning of the s, plans were elaborated for the restoration of\n        historical hydrological conditions. At the same time, a series of\n        investigations started to document the effects of the hydraulic works on\n        flora and fauna. Of general interest was the reduction of the very high\n        salinity (Perdomo et al., ;\n        <mark class=\"entity gpe\">Blanco et al.</mark>\n        , ; Rivera-Monroy et al., , ). Concerning botanical aspects, particular\n        attention was paid to mangrove regeneration at different sites (Perdomo\n        et al., ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Studies were conducted on propagule\n        production and spread (Ensminger, ;\n        <mark class=\"entity gpe\">Schubert</mark>\n        , ) as well as seedling establishment and growth (Elster et al., ;\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Perdomo</mark>\n        and Schnetter, ). Remote sensing data were used to assess the expansion\n        of mangroves (Sanchez-Paez et al., ; Ibarra et al., ) and to produce a\n        canopy height map (Simard et al., ). Models were elaborated to predict\n        the future development of the mangrove forests (\n        <mark class=\"entity gpe\">Twilley et al.</mark>\n        , ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Soon after the beginning of the restoration\n        measures in , it became clear that regeneration in the eastern, more\n        saline part of the lagoon system and the western part differed. While\n        mangroves recovered step by step to the original species composition and\n        zonation in the eastern part, establishment of new mangroves was slow in\n        the western part. Instead, a rapid spread of herbaceous freshwater\n        plants was observed (Perdomo et al., ; Alvarez-Leon et al., ;\n        Sanchez-Paez et al., ). Among the most frequent species was Typha\n        domingensis Pers. (cattail), a native of the freshwater wetlands near\n        <mark class=\"entity loc\">the Magdalena River</mark>\n        (Romero-Castaneda, ). Within\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">three years</mark>\n        Typha beds occupied large parts of former mangrove areas. But it was not\n        clear how this species had been able to establish itself in still very\n        saline sediments (Alvarez-Leon et al., ). An establishment of T.\n        domingensis after the death of mangrove vegetation was already reported\n        by Rubin et al. (). But in this case it was restricted to sites with low\n        salinity (- PSU). Therefore the successful expansion on saline sediments\n        raised our curiosity, and we wondered whether persistent\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Typha</mark>\n        beds would prevent mangrove recolonization.Our hypothesis was that\n        mangrove regeneration would be delayed as long as cattail occupied the\n        former mangrove areas. To answer this question we started a series of\n        studies in aimed at determining the prevailing factors that enabled T.\n        domin-gensis to become established in these areas. We hypothesized that\n        the low surface water salinity together with the presence of large bare\n        areas allowed the establishment of T. domingensis and that variations in\n        salinity of surface water influenced its growth. The influence of the\n        cattail on the growth of mangrove trees was tested with Rhizophora\n        mangle L. seedlings planted in\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">the year</mark>\n        at km south of the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road (Fig. B) (Sanchez-Paez et\n        al., ). Our hypothesis was that low light intensity inside the\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Typha</mark>\n        beds would influence the growth of the seedlings. These studies were\n        completed by data of surface water salinity and vegetation composition\n        recorded in irregular intervals at three sites south of the\n        Barranquilla-Cienaga Road (Fig. B) from to . The comparison of plant\n        lists made it possible to demonstrate similarities and differences\n        between the original vegetation and that which became established after\n        the restoration of suitable hydrological conditions. Moreover, the data\n        enabled us to look for correlations between the different plant cover\n        and the respective hydrological conditions. We hypothesized that\n        variations of surface water salinity were particularly important for\n        vegetation changes. Therefore we tested the influence of different\n        environmental factors together with time on state and extent of the\n        three vegetation types: mangroves, T. domingensis and freshwater herbs\n        without T. domingensis (w.T.d.). These analyses should help us to answer\n        our hypothesis about the possible delay of mangrove regeneration by the\n        presence of T. domingensis. . Materials and methods ..

In\n        the north, the lagoon system is separated from the sea by a sandy\n        barrier,\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">the Isla de Salamanca</mark>\n        . Sea water can enter the lagoon system through\n        <mark class=\"entity fac\">the Boca de la Barra</mark>\n        located on the eastern end of the barrier island (Fig. A). Several\n        rivers originating in the\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Sierra Nevada</mark>\n        provide a continuous supply of freshwater (about m s-) to the Cienaga\n        <mark class=\"entity gpe\">Grande</mark>\n        lagoon (Mann et al., ). Connections with\n        <mark class=\"entity loc\">the Magdalena River</mark>\n        allowed the in-flow of additional freshwater (up to m s-) to the western\n        part of the lagoon system until and after the termination of the\n        restoration measures (Cotes, ). The climate of the region is hot and\n        dry. With a mean annual temperature of °C and a mean\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">annual</mark>\n        rainfall of mm in the eastern part of the region and around mm in the\n        western part, evaporation generally exceeds precipitation. Rainfalls\n        occur during two wet seasons of differing intensities (Fig. ). While the\n        duration and distribution of dry and wet seasons is very stable, the\n        total annual rainfall can vary considerably over\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">the years</mark>\n        (Fig. ). These differences are related to\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">El Nino-Southern Oscillation</mark>\n        (ENSO) events (\n        <mark class=\"entity gpe\">Blanco et al.</mark>\n        , ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Due to the seasonal distribution of\n        rainfall and the simultaneous variation of river discharge, the lagoons\n        and channels show seasonal changes of water level. Fluctuations in water\n        level due to tides are noticeable only near\n        <mark class=\"entity fac\">the Boca de la Barra</mark>\n        (Wiedemann, ). Because of the proximity of the sea and the connection\n        between the Fig. .\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">Annual</mark>\n        rainfall (mm) from to . Data of rainfall from the meteorological station\n        Sevillano, °' N, °' W. sea and the lagoon system, water and soils are\n        saline almost everywhere, although to a varying extent. According to our\n        observations, salt concentration is significantly influenced by the\n        distance from a fresh water source, the duration and level of flooding,\n        and the amount of water exchange among neighboring water bodies. Human\n        interventions began with the construction of\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road</mark>\n        between and (Fig. A). This road interrupted water exchange between the\n        northern and southern part of\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">the Isla de Salamanca</mark>\n        (Fig. A). In the s, freshwater flow from\n        <mark class=\"entity loc\">the Magdalena River</mark>\n        to the lagoon system declined greatly, due to silting of channels\n        connecting\n        <mark class=\"entity loc\">the Magdalena River</mark>\n        to the lagoon system and the construction of a road which bordered\n        <mark class=\"entity loc\">the Magdalena River</mark>\n        at its eastern side (Fig. A). At\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">the end of the th century</mark>\n        , efforts were made toward a restoration of the original hydrological\n        conditions of the lagoon system. The most important measures were the\n        re-opening of the silted channels Cano Clann, Cano Aguas Negras and Cano\n        Renegado-Condazo (Fig. A) between and . The objectives of these works\n        were the renovation of the fresh water supply and the reduction of the\n        elevated salinity (Perdomo et al., ;\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Cotes</mark>\n        , ;\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Rivera-Monroy et al.</mark>\n        , ). Water in the channels flows along a natural altitudinal gradient\n        from the river to\n        <mark class=\"entity fac\">the Boca de la Barra</mark>\n        and the sea. Intense rainfall in , , and (Fig. ) assisted in the\n        reduction of salt concentrations of water and soils (Blanco et al., ;\n        Rivera-Monroy et al., , ). In the years -, salinity increase due to less\n        rainfall (Fig. ) again changed the growth conditions of the vegetation\n        (Blanco et al., ; Rivera-Monroy et al., ). Variable environmental\n        conditions of the lagoon system permit the presence of different plant\n        communities. The spectrum ranges from tropical thorn bush and wetland\n        forests growing near the rivers in soils which are flooded periodically,\n        to communities of wetland and halophytic herbs and mangroves.\n        Depressions without drainage lack vegetation because of high salt\n        concentrations. Among the plant communities, mangroves are most\n        important (Alvarez-Leon et al., ; Sanchez-Paez et al., ). Because of the\n        richness of its plant and animal life, the lagoon system comprises two\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">National Parks</mark>\n        and has been declared as a\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Ramsar</mark>\n        site and\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Biosphere Reserve</mark>\n        . All studies reported here took place in a part of the lagoon system\n        located west of the Cienaga Grande lagoon (Fig. A and B). Beginning in ,\n        research about surface water salinity and composition of the vegetation\n        has been carried out at km , km and km south of\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road</mark>\n        at irregular intervals until\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">June</mark>\n        (Table , Fig. B). Growth of T. domingensis was investigated\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">between September</mark>\n        and\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">February</mark>\n        in nine study sites that received water from the channels Cano Clann or\n        Cano Aguas Negras (Table , Fig. B). Tests about the influence of T.\n        domingensis on the growth of planted seedlings of\n        <mark class=\"entity norp\">R.</mark>\n        mangle took place from\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">August</mark>\n        to\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">April</mark>\n        at km south of\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road</mark>\n        (Table , Fig. B). The seedlings were planted in\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">March</mark>\n        by the Asociacion Colombiana de Aforesta-dores (Sanchez-Paez et al., ).\n        Cattail was absent at the site in the moment of planting, but expanded\n        in\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">the following months</mark>\n        . When the study started, one part of the seedlings grew inside the\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Typha</mark>\n        bed and the other part outside in sediment covered mainly by\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">Sporobolus virginicus</mark>\n        (L.)

Water and soil measurements From\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">November</mark>\n        to\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">September</mark>\n        , at intervals of\n        <mark class=\"entity date\">about three months</mark>\n        , surface water samples were collected at\n        <mark class=\"entity gpe\">km</mark>\n        , and south of\n        <mark class=\"entity org\">the Barranquilla-Cienaga Road</mark>\n        , and salinity was determined in the laboratory by measuring the\n        chloride content by titration with silver nitrate.
